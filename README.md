Brief Introduction-
---
This project is designed to be a simple website with basic functionality like display information, and most complex function is to recieve emails.
Therefore, with that in mind decided to go without the traditional front-end and back-end and made it a static page in order to save costs and simplfy hosting.
This is a static HTML page which will be hosted using Netlify which is great for hosting static websites.
